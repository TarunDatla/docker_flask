                The A80 program began in February 1989 under various teams for design, product planning, and engineering
                led by Isao Tsuzuki. By the middle of 1990, a final A80 design concept from Toyota Technical Centre
                Aichi was approved and frozen for production in late 1990. The first test mules were hand-built in A70
                bodies during late 1990, followed by the first A80 prototypes being hand-assembled in 1991. Again using
                subframe, suspension, and drivetrain assemblies from the Z30 Soarer (Lexus SC300/400), pre-production of
                the test models started in December 1992 with 20 units made,[23] and official mass production began in
                April 1999. The fourth generation of the Supra again shared its platform with the
                upscale Soarer coupé, sold in the U.S. as the Lexus SC. Although the two cars looked similar
                dimension-wise, the new Supra was more than 13 inches (340 mm) shorter than its luxurious cousin.[32]

                This redesign saw Toyota placing great emphasis on a more serious high-performance car. The A80 featured
                two new engines: a naturally aspirated Toyota 2JZ-GE having a power output of 164 kW (220 hp; 223 PS) at
                5,800 rpm and 210 lb⋅ft (285 N⋅m) at 4,800 rpm of torque and a twin turbocharged Toyota 2JZ-GTE having a
                power output of 206 kW (276 hp; 280 PS) and 318 lb⋅ft (431 N⋅m) of torque for the Japanese model. For
                the export model (American/European markets) Toyota upgraded the Supra turbo's engine (by installing
                smaller, steel wheeled turbochargers and bigger fuel injectors, etc.). This increased the power output
                to 239 kW (321 hp; 325 PS)at 5,600 rpm and 315 lb⋅ft (427 N⋅m) of torque at 4,000 rpm (243 kW (326 hp;
                330 PS) and 325 lb⋅ft (441 N⋅m) for European markets) Upon its launch in 1993, it was the first
                Toyota-badged vehicle to include a passenger airbag as standard (US-market only).[23]

                The turbocharged variant could accelerate 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in as low as 4.6 seconds and cover 402 m
                (1⁄4 mile) in 13.1 seconds at 175 km/h (109 mph).[33] Car and Driver magazine includes a rollout in
                their 4.6 seconds test (typically about 0.3 second) that they subtract from the acceleration
                figures.[34] The turbo version has a tested top speed of 257 km/h (160 mph),[35] but the cars are
                restricted to just 180 km/h (112 mph) in Japan and 250 km/h (155 mph) in worldwide markets. European
                versions of the car also had an air intake or scoop on the hood. It has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.31
                for the naturally aspirated models and 0.32 for the turbo models but unknown with the rear spoiler.

                The twin turbochargers operated in sequential mode instead of parallel. Initially, all of the exhaust
                gases are routed to the first turbine for reduced lag. This resulted in boost and enhanced torque as
                early as 1,800 rpm, where it already produced 300 lb⋅ft (407 N⋅m) of torque. At 3,500 rpm, some of the
                exhaust gases are routed to the second turbine for a "pre-boost" mode, although none of the compressor
                output is used by the engine at this point. At 4,000 rpm, the second turbo's output is used to augment
                the first turbo's output. Compared to the parallel mode, sequential mode turbo chargers provide quicker
                low RPM response and increased high RPM boost. This high RPM boost was also aided with technology
                originally present in the 7M-GE in the form of the Acoustic Control Induction System (ACIS) which is a
                way of managing the air compression pulses within the intake piping as to increase power.

                For this generation, the Supra received a new six-speed Getrag/Toyota V160 gearbox on the turbo models
                while the naturally aspirated models were equipped with a five-speed manual W58 transmission, revised
                from the previous model. Each model was offered with a four-speed automatic with manual shifting mode.
                All vehicles were equipped with five-spoke aluminum alloy wheels, the naturally aspirated models had
                16-inch wheels and the turbo models had 17-inch wheels. The difference in wheel size was to accommodate
                the larger brakes equipped as standard on the turbo model, but in Japan were optional extras. Both
                models had a space saver spare tyre on a steel rim to save both space and weight.
